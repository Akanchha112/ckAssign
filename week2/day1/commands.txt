Linux Assignment

Q1- Find and terminate the top memory-consuming process on your system.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ top - The top command displays a dynamic, real-time view of: CPU usage, Memory usage, Running processes, System load. It is similar to Task Manager in Windows.
press shift+M to short by memory usage and shift + p to short by cpu usage again
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ kill 4675 - kill <PID>: Sends the default SIGTERM signal (signal 15), which requests the process to terminate gracefully.


Q2. Create a user named devops and grant them sudo privileges.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ sudo adduser test - sudo in Linux is a command-line utility that allows authorized users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user, most commonly the superuser (root). The name "sudo" is a contraction of "superuser do."
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ groups test - check what privilages test user already has
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ sudo usermod -aG sudo test - Run usermod as superuser, appending (-a) the user test to the group sudo (-G sudo).

user is ->
    username- test 
    pass - test123


Q3. Connect to a remote server, create a directory, and copy files into it using SCP.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ssh aditi-bhadoria@10.1.210.150
aditi-bhadoria@CK-aditibhadoria:~$ mkdir ~/linux_practical
aditi-bhadoria@CK-aditibhadoria:~$ ls
aditi-bhadoria@CK-aditibhadoria:~$ exit
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ scp /home/akanchha-singh/Documents/practice/a1.txt aditi-bhadoria@10.1.210.150:/home/aditi-bhadoria/linux_practical/


Q4. List all active processes and save only those containing the word java into a file.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ps aux | grep 'java'  

ps – shows current running processes.
a – includes processes of all users.
u – displays detailed information (user, CPU, memory, etc.).
x – shows background processes without a terminal.
| – pipes output from one command to another.
grep 'java' – filters and shows only lines containing “java.


Q5. Generate an SSH key pair and configure it for two different remote servers.

Q6. Find all lines containing “error” in /var/log/syslog and redirect them to errors_found.txt
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog > errors_found.txt

grep "error" → searches for the word error in the file.
/var/log/syslog → this is the file where your system keeps logs.
> → means “save the output into a file.”
errors_found.txt → the new file that will store the results.
-i -> ignore case when searching — treat ERROR, Error, and error as the same.

Q7. Find all .conf files in /etc, sort them alphabetically, and save to conf_list.txt.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ls /etc | grep "*.conf"
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ls /etc | grep *.conf
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ls /etc | grep "*.conf"
none of above showed result because when run ls /etc on modern Ubuntu systems, ls adds color codes and formatting (for readability).
These colors are actually non-printable escape sequences, which means the text that grep receives is not plain text, but includes invisible color characters. and it shows like this <color-code>bash.conf<color-reset> not just bash.conf.
Hence, no match is found.
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ls --color=never /etc | grep ".conf"
adduser.conf
apg.conf
brltty.conf
ca-certificates.conf
cma.conf
dconf
debconf.conf
deluser.conf
dhcpcd.conf
e2scrub.conf
fprintd.conf
fuse.conf
gai.conf
hdparm.conf

This is also working:
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ ls /etc  | grep "\.conf"
adduser.conf
apg.conf
brltty.conf
ca-certificates.conf
cma.conf
debconf.conf
deluser.conf
dhcpcd.conf
e2scrub.conf
fprintd.conf
fuse.conf
gai.conf
hdparm.conf




Q8. Display the total number of unique shell types listed in /etc/passwd and save to shell_count.txt
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f7 | sort | uniq | wc -l > shell_count.txt
akanchha-singh@TTNPL-akanchhasingh:~$ cat shell_count.txt
5


Q9. Explore vi/vim for  Creating a text file. Understand cursor movement, switching input mode (append, insert etc), deleting command, pasting content, undo , redo ,search , save and quit operations in vim.


Q10. Reset the current user password and reboot the system form shell.

Q11. Zip the content of your home directory via tar and send it via scp to other person laptop. Unzip the content on other person laptop via tar.

Q12. Install and setup application via apt - mysql, postman, docker, dbeaver
